# Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the quality of wine
based on its chemical characteristics using machine learning
classification models. This project demonstrates how different
classifiers can be applied and compared for predictive analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the wine quality dataset
- Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling
- Analyzed chemical features influencing wine quality
- Applied feature scaling for better model performance
- Built multiple classification models:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Compared model performance using accuracy metrics
- Visualized results using confusion matrix

## Outcome & Learnings
- Machine learning models can effectively predict wine quality
- Random Forest performed better compared to other classifiers
- Feature scaling is crucial for algorithms like SVC and SGD
- Gained practical experience in classification model comparison
